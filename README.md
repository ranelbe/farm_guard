# farm_guard
A project built using raspberry PI 4 and its camera to detect snakes and scare them off, preventing them from entering chicken coops and eating them and their eggs.
It consists of the following components:
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Motion Detection Algorithm</b><br>
    A smart motion detection algorithm to capture frames when motion occurs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Pre-trained Model</b><br>
    Utilizes a reliable pre-trained object detection model. <br>
    This model undergoes training with a diverse dataset to enhance its effectiveness in recognizing snakes.
  </li>
   <li>
    <b>Alert Mechanisms</b><br>
    The system sends alert messages via Telegram and SMS when snake activity is detected.
  </li>
</ul>
